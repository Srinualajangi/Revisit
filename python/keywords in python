Here are some important Python keywords:
1.and: returns True if both operates are True
2.or: returns True if atleast one of the operands is true.
3.not: returns the opposite of the openrands truth value.
4.if: conditional statement
5.else: used conjuction with if.
6.elif: else if, checks additional conditions after an if statement used with combination if and else.
7.while: create a loop that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
8.for: It is used to create a loop that iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence
9.in: Used with for, it checks if a value is present in a sequence.
10.try: It is the beginning of a block of code that is subject to exception handling. It is followed by except to catch and handle exceptions.
11.except: Used with try, it defines a block of code to execute when an exception is raised in the corresponding try block.
12.finally: Used with try, it defines a block of code that is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not.
13.def: It is used to define a function in Python.
14.return: It is used within a function to specify the value that the function should return.
15.class: It is used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming.
16.import: It is used to import modules or libraries to access their functions, classes, or variables.
17.from: Used with import to specify which specific components from a module should be imported.
18.as: Used with import to create an alias for a module, making it easier to reference in the code.
19.True: It represents a boolean value for "true."
20.False: It represents a boolean value for "false."
21.None: It represents a special null value or absence of value.
22.is: It is used for identity comparison, checking if two variables refer to the same object in memory.
23.lambda: It is used to create small, anonymous functions (lambda functions).
24.with: It is used for context management, ensuring that certain operations are performed before and after a block of code.
25.global: It is used to declare a global variable within a function's scope.
26.nonlocal: It is used to declare a variable as nonlocal, which allows modifying a variable in an enclosing (but non-global) scope
