Desktop Applications
Disadvantages:


Requires installation on each system
Consumes local storage
Needs manual upgrades
Problem fixing is manual
Risk of system crash → application unavailable
Consumes system resources


Web-Based Applications
Advantages:


No installation required
No manual upgrades (handled on server)
No compatibility issues (browser-based)
No local storage dependency
Accessible from anywhere


Web Applications → 3-Tier Architecture


Web Tier: Handles user interface and requests
App/API Tier: Processes business logic
Data Tier: Stores and retrieves data

Analogy: Restaurant Model

Roadside Cart: One person does everything (cooking, billing, serving)
Small Hotel: Owner + Cook (basic division of work)
Restaurant: Specialized roles

Waiter → Web Server (handles requests, queue management)
Chef → App Server (processes orders/business logic)
Raw Items → Database (stores data)



Data Representation

Database: Tables and columns (e.g., user_id, user_name, password)
App Server: Executes SQL queries for CRUD operations
Example:
SELECT * FROM user WHERE user_name='sivakumar' AND password='siva123';
Web Server: Converts data into HTML/JSON for user display
Example JSON:
{ "user": "sivakumar", "dob": "01-01-01", "location": "bangalore" }


Technology Stack


Web Tier (Frontend): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Angular
App/API Tier (Backend): Java, Python, NodeJS, .NET, Go
Data Tier: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Redis

Static vs Dynamic

Static Content: HTML/CSS → Served by Nginx, Apache
Dynamic Content: Backend apps → JBoss, WebSphere, WebLogic, Tomcat


DevOps Practice Setup

Login with:
Username: ec2-user
Password: DevOps321 (D and O are caps)


Database Server Setup


Install MySQL:
sudo dnf install mysql-server
Start service:
sudo systemctl start mysqld
sudo systemctl status mysqld
Check:
netstat -lntp      # Check port
ps -ef | grep mysql # Check process
Default user: root
Client connection:
mysql -u root -p
mysql -h  -u root -p
Basic commands:
