for(int i=0;i<=100;i++{
	print i;
}

Acer Swift go 14
i5, 16GB --> 62k

	echo $i
done

logs are very important for any coding

redirectors
--------------
ls -l > output.txt --> by default it redirects only success output
1 --> success
2 --> error

ls -l 2> output.txt --> redirect only error output

ls -l &> output.txt

16-redirectors.sh --> 16-redirectors

/var/log/shell-script/16-redirectors-<timestamp>.log

Tee commands.
==========================
âœ… Key Uses

Log output while viewing it.
Append or overwrite files.
Combine with other commands in pipelines.

ls -l | tee output.txt --> Save output to a file and display on screen
ls -l | tee -a output.txt --> -a appends instead of overwriting.
echo "Hello World " | tee file1.txt file2.txt
echo "New Config" | sudo tee /etc/myconfig.conf 
cat file.txt | tee copy.txt | grep "error" --> Saves a copy of file.txt to copy.txt and then searches for "error".
