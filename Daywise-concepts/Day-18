✅ Core Ansible Concepts


Variables

Used to store dynamic values for tasks and playbooks.
Example:
YAML
course:  name: "DevOps with AWS"  duration: 120  trainer: "sivakumar reddy"Show more lines




Conditions (when)

Apply tasks only if certain conditions are met.
Example:
YAMLwhen: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"Show more lines




Loops

Repeat tasks for multiple items.
Example:
YAML
loop:  - item1  - item2
Show more lines




Data Types

YAML supports scalars, lists, and dictionaries.
Example:
YAML- , [][  { "key": "name", "value": "DevOps with AWS" },  { "key": "duration", "value": 120 }]Show more lines



✅ Functions vs Filters

Ansible doesn’t allow custom functions directly like Python.
To extend functionality, you write Python plugins or use filters.
Filters = used for data manipulation in templates and tasks.

Example:
YAML{{ variable | upper }}Show more lines





✅ Command vs Shell Modules

command:

Executes simple commands without shell environment.
More secure.


shell:

Executes complex commands (pipes, redirection).
Provides shell environment.


Best Practice: Use command if possible.


✅ Ansible Beyond Configuration Management

Can connect to any system if a module exists.
Integrates with AWS using aws modules.
Requires AWS CLI setup:
Shellaws configureShow more lines



✅ Expense Project Example

3 servers: MySQL, Backend, Frontend.
Private IPs for internal communication.
Public IP for domain access.
Demonstrates multi-tier architecture automation.


🔑 Key Takeaways

Variables, loops, and conditions are fundamental.
Filters = data manipulation; custom logic needs Python.
Prefer command over shell for security.
Ansible is versatile: CM + Cloud automation.
YAML structure matters for readability and correctness.
